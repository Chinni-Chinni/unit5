1.Create a database of movies of your choice. Each movie object will have properties like ‘name, release date, poster (add url of a poster), IMDb rating, etc.

Create at least 9 movies object, push all of them as array items. Store the array in local storage with key 'movies'.

Whenever the user visits index.html, show the movies in 3*3 grid ( 3 columns, 3 rows ).


2.  Create ‘Sort by low rating to high, Sort by High rating to low` buttons. Give them "sort-lh" and "sort-hl" as HTML id's respectively.

    When a user clicks on any of the above buttons, he should be able to see to the movies in a sorted fashion depending on their IMDb ratings.
